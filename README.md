# mcMMOAction

![Action-bar messages](https://i.imgur.com/QYvRTRA.png)

## Description

This lightweight plugin is based on the feature request from [here](https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO/issues/2659).
It forwards some useful mcMMO messages to the action chat. Instead that these messages spam the regular chat,
you'll see them above the item-bar and they will disappear after a shorten time. This plugin has no config. Just drop
the plugin in your plugins folder and start your server.
